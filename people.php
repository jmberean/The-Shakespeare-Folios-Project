        <h1>Cyrus Mulready</h1>
        <p>is Associate Professor of English at SUNY New Paltz, where he teaches classes on Shakespeare, early British Literature, book history, and material culture. The author of Romance on the Early Modern Stage: English Expansion before and after Shakespeare (Palgrave, 2013), he has also published essays on genre and the social foundations of literary form.</p>   
        <h1>Adam Hooks</h1>
        <p>is Associate Professor of English at the University of Iowa. He is the author of Selling Shakespeare: Biography, Bibliography, and the Book Trade (Cambridge UP, 2016), which tells the story of Shakespeare’s life and career in print, a story centered on the people who created, bought, and sold books in the early modern period. His current project is “Faking Shakespeare,” a critical history of Shakespearean authenticity and forgery that traces the origins of the very idea of “faking” Shakespeare and shows how authority has been fabricated, fragmented, and exploited by editors, critics, publishers, and readers.</p>   
        <h1>Emma Smith</h1>
        <p>is Professor of Shakespeare Studies at University of Oxford and Fellow and Tutor at Hertford College. Her most recent work has been immersed in the First Folio. In The Making of the First Folio (Bodleian Libraries, 2015), she discusses the practical and literary aspects of this book in its early modern context. Shakespeare’s First Folio: Four Centuries of an Iconic Book (Oxford UP, 2016) takes the story of the history of that book up to the present day.  She is also co-curator of the 2016 Bodleian exhibit, Shakespeare’s Dead and editor of The Cambridge Companion to Shakespeare’s First Folio (Cambridge UP, 2016).</p>
